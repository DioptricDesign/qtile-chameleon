# Qtile-Config
A feature rich qtile config. It is meant to be used with pywal and many other utilities that to offer a novel aesthetic experience and a utilitarian workflow. It uses pywal and feh to cycle through bacground images in ~/.local/share/backgrounds. 
## Other Projects
This config should be used with the [scripts](https://github.com/DioptricDesign/scripts) in my scripts repo and my [startpage](https://github.com/DioptricDesign/min-startpage) for the most comprehensive expirience.

## Special Thanks
Many ideas for this configuration were taken from existing configurations in the Qtile examples [repo](https://github.com/qtile/qtile-examples) and Derek Taylor's [Qtile config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.config/qtile).
